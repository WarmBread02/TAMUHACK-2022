# TAMUHACK-2022
Tamuhack 2022 Project 


This is the tamuhack project


Chases Idea for the project:

Given a name and headshot, Scrape through finding their potential social media. Compare this with a facial scan given the headshot to confirm if this social media is the one in the same, and then, scan each social media picture, and terminology, to determine if the user has a righteous lifestyle. Once the social medias have all been checked, we can then give a final score, that would see if they are liable for a great deal.

Examples of demerits:

Pictures of them with cigarettes

Text that gives a rude and/or negative result

All of this data collection would be legal, as everything would be public information.

It's about risk. Home owners and renters cover things like fire, flooding, hail damage, etc.  For life insurance that's the risk of you passing away early.
So, what kinds of things make it less likely to have a fire, or have your home flooded, as examples. Being healthier makes you live longer.

home owners and renters insurance :

check location,

find if theres any weather issues in the past within that location

find if there is usage of parties within their social media

find if there is talk of parties in their social media

life insurance :

check  social medias based off of their public username

attempt to match that social media with their face, if possible



For driving (that reference point). We will get data like whether or not you are slamming your brakes, how long are your average trips (are you driving more), are you taking off really fast, etc.
